# Shark Tank Crew AI

## Overview
Shark Tank Crew AI is an innovative Python-based project designed to simulate a collaborative environment inspired by the popular TV show "Shark Tank." The project leverages advanced AI tools and agents to refine business ideas, evaluate their feasibility, and produce a polished investment pitch. This simulation is powered by the `crewai` framework and integrates various tools and language models to create a dynamic and interactive experience.

## Features
- **AI Agents:**
  - **Entrepreneur:** Develops and refines groundbreaking business ideas.
  - **Technical Shark:** Analyzes technical feasibility and innovation.
  - **Marketing Shark:** Evaluates market viability and branding strategies.
  - **Financial Shark:** Scrutinizes business models and financial projections.
- **Tools:**
  - `SerperDevTool` for search-based research.
  - `ScrapeWebsiteTool` for web scraping.
- **Language Models:**
  - `ChatOpenAI` for generating and refining content.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:**
   - The project starts with an initial business idea provided by the Entrepreneur agent.
   - Environment variables are loaded using `dotenv` to manage API keys securely.

2. **Agent Collaboration:**
   - Each agent performs specific tasks to evaluate and refine the business idea.
   - Tasks include creating a pitch, analyzing technical feasibility, market viability, and financial projections.

3. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Feedback from the agents is consolidated, and the Entrepreneur refines the pitch based on this feedback.
   - The process repeats until the pitch is deemed "Investment Ready."

4. **Output:**
   - The final investment pitch is saved to `final_pitch.md` and displayed in the console.

## Workflow
The Shark Tank Crew AI operates in a dynamic loop to refine business ideas. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Initial Idea:**
   - The Entrepreneur agent starts with an initial business idea.

2. **Task Execution:**
   - Each agent (Technical Shark, Marketing Shark, Financial Shark) evaluates the idea based on their expertise and provides feedback.

3. **Pitch Refinement:**
   - The Entrepreneur integrates the feedback to refine the pitch.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - The refined pitch is evaluated to determine if it is "Investment Ready."

5. **Loop Continuation:**
   - If the pitch is not ready, the process repeats with the updated pitch.
   - The loop continues until the pitch is deemed "Investment Ready" or the maximum number of turns is reached.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:
- `python-dotenv`
- `crewai`
- `crewai-tools`
- `langchain-openai`

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shark_tank
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python shark_tank_crew.py
   ```

## File Structure
- `shark_tank_crew.py`: Main script containing the logic for the Shark Tank simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `final_pitch.md`: Stores the final investment pitch generated by the agents.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional AI models and tools.
- Support for more complex business scenarios.
- Enhanced user interface for better interaction.
